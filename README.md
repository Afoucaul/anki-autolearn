# Autolearn for Anki

You wish you could keep on studying while working all day long on your PC?
Autolearn is here for you!

This simple plugin will make Anki appear in foreground at a customizable time interval, to have you study every now and then.
As soon as you answered a card, Anki will vanish and let you work, only to appear some minutes later with a fresh new one.


## Installation

You can install this add-on just like any other regular add-on.
First, clone this repo, then open Anki, go to `Tools > Add-ons > View files` to check the directory where add-ons are installed, and finally copy (or better, make a symlink) the `src` directory into the add-ons directory.


## How to

The configuration of this add-on is plain simple and straightforward.
You'll find in the `Tools` menu a `Autolearn` line, that will open a simple dialog.
There, you can set up the delay between two appearances from Anki.
That's it!
